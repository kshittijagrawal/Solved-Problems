## Prompt
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the *longest consecutive elements* sequence.  
  
**Follow up**: Could you implement the **O(n)** solution?

## Examples
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```
  
## Constraints
* 0 <= **nums.length** <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= **nums[i]** <= 10<sup>9</sup>
  
## Complexities
* The **Time Complexity** for the implementation : NLogN
  * Runtime : **68 ms**  
* The **Space Complexity** for the implementation : Constant
  * Memory : **15.0 mb**
