# Solved-Problems
The repository contains all the problems solved by me on [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), particularly using Python. While a few of the approaches involve the typical methodology used to solve the particular type of problems, the others involve observation and personal implementation.  

This could help acing the coding interview.
Happy Coding!
