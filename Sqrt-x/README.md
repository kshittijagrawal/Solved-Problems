## Prompt
Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the **square root of x**.  
  
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and *only the integer part of the result is returned*.  
  
## Examples
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
  
## Constraints
* 0 <= **x** <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1  
  
## Complexities
* The **Time Complexity** for the implementation : Log(N)
  * Runtime : **36 ms**  
* The **Space Complexity** for the implementation : Constant
  * Memory : **14.1 mb**
